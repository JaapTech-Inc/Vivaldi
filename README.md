**I want to say that Vivaldi is just in alpha.**
**Do not critique if it was a professional app.**

# Vivaldi
A basic photo editor

## How it works
When you add a image on Vivaldi, Vivaldi converts your file data to a bitmap, next when you change the RBG channels, Vivaldi gets that bitmap and changes all the pixels rbg to himselfs + the rgb trackbars value.
